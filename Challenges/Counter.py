# The counter needs to count UP TO 5 from 1 and then reset

#count = 5
#while (count >= 0):
#	print(count)
#	count = count-1
	
#count = 5

#while count >= 0:
#	print(count)
#	count = count-1

#count = 5

# this code below is the for and in loop meeky showed me that I have now touched on in lesson 5.1
#for num in range(count):
#	print(num)
#	count = 1

#Let's try and do better than the above.

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count = count+1
while count >= 5:
    count = count-5
    print(count)
#for count in range(count)
#JUST LOOK AT THE WILL FISET VIDEOS IN LESSONS 5 AND I AM SURE I'LL LEARN TO LOOP THIS!
