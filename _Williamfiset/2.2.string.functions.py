# 2.2 string functions

science = "SCIENCE"
apple = "apple"
print(apple)
# the upper function trasnforms the apple variable to all upper cases
apple = apple.upper()
print(apple)
# I can refer to the string API at www.python.org documentation and go to library reference

# using these functions can save time with our variable strings using different styles
print(science.lower())

apple = "         apple         "
print(apple.strip().upper())
# here we show case the use of multiple functions for one variable
